# GUI for Multiple CV Tasks

This project integrates various Computer Vision tasks into a single Graphical User Interface, allowing users to easily experiment with and visualize different CV algorithms. From camera calibration to feature matching and model training, this GUI provides a hands-on approach to learning and testing CV concepts.

## Code Files Overview

- **1_Chess**: Camera calibration using chessboard images.
- **2_AR**: Demonstrates Augmented Reality by overlaying digital objects onto the real world.
- **3_Disparity**: Generates disparity maps for depth perception from stereo images.
- **4_SIFT_test**: Tests SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) feature matching.
- **5_cifar10_train**: Trains a model on the CIFAR-10 dataset for object recognition.

## Getting Started

To experience the various CV tasks through the GUI, simply run `GUI_CV.py`. This will launch the interface from which you can select and interact with the different CV algorithms implemented.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- glob
- tensoflow
- keras
- PyQt5

## How to use
After installing the prerequisites, navigate to the directory containing `GUI_CV.py` and run it using:

```bash
python GUI_CV.py

The GUI will present options to select the CV task you wish to explore. Each task provides a unique interface tailored to its specific requirements, offering an interactive way to learn and experiment with CV techniques.

## Features
- Interactive GUI: Simplifies the exploration of complex CV tasks.
- Diverse CV Algorithms: From basic image processing to deep learning models.
- Real-time Visualization: Immediate feedback for educational and development purposes.
